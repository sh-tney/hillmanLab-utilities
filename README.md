# Hillman Lab Utilities & Guides

This repository contains a set of guides and small utilities created for the purposes of the Hillman Lab at the University of Otago, for a project oriented around studying the correlates of rat behaviour and vocalizations. The material in this repository serves a dual purpose; both to serve as a guide for other members of the lab & community to use in their own projects, and also to document the processes used in the Hillman Lab project.

I'm more than happy to hear any questions, clarifications, error fixes, bugs, etc. either on Github, or I'm always available at sh.tney@gmail.com I'm not a part of the DeepLabCut or DeepSqueak teams; the guides placed here are for additional support of the community to cover their software in a way that aims to be more meticulous as a step-by-step, and tailored toward those who are just getting started with network based analysis, or maybe just less computer-savvy in general.
